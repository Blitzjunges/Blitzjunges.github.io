      The website's purpose is to show what I like about mathematics. This is a
      graph that shows what propositions are based on what propositions. Just
      hover over a vertex, and it will highlight their parents and children.
      The data was scraped from the wonderful translation from Richard
      Fitzpatrick.<br>If you are interested in also reading the propositions and
      not only looking at them, then
      <a href="https://farside.ph.utexas.edu/Books/Euclid/Elements.pdf">here</a>
      you can read Richard Fitzpatrick's translation.<br>I hope you enjoy it as
      much as I do!</p>
